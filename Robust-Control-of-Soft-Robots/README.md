# Robust-Control-of-Soft-Robots
This repo contains all code and data used to support the work of Robust Control of Electrohydraulic Soft Robots. All necessary code is included for data collection, controller synthesis, real-time control implementation, and post-processing of data. The files are either MATLAB files, contained in a platformIO package, or are contained in a ROS package as python or cpp files.
Methods within this project include those specifically related to linear systems and robust control theory, including the use of h-infinity synthesis and mu-analysis approaches.
